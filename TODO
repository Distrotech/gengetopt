if configure doesn't find getopt, it should say to the programmer
that we provide getopt.c getopt1.c and getopt.h, which will be installed
in $(prefix)/share/gengetopt

write texinfo documentation

Check if non-required options are all generated within [] when long
help is required

remove some rules in parser.y by using possible empty symbols
(such as argtype...)

yesno should really be required?  If not given could be inferred as "no".

CONF PARSER

allow lines with comments at the end:
option value # comment

OPTIONS

additional options such as multiple and argoptional could be
given also in different order...  make a list of such options

ENUM

also in parsing, create an option struct, so that parsing rules
can be re-used easily (e.g., the group options)

Implement synonyms

Should - be always interpreted as the standard output

Generate code that uses Argp

Duplicate options: A @dfn{duplicate option} is an option that, like a
multiple option, may be specified more than once, but for which only
the last use is significant.   The classic example is the @option{-O}
switch present in most C compilers:

Test no-handle-help, no-handle-version, also in the presence
of hidden options
