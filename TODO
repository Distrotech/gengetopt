GENERAL TASKS:

* Generate C++ code

* Generate Java code

The current maintainer is taking patches. See the file `AUTHORS'.

Implement synonyms

Should - be always interpreted as the standard output

Generate code that uses Argp

Duplicate options: A @dfn{duplicate option} is an option that, like a
multiple option, may be specified more than once, but for which only
the last use is significant.   The classic example is the @option{-O}
switch present in most C compilers:

maintainer-mode

CLEANING

- code duplication in check_option and create_option in gengetopt.cc

TESTS

generate in the code also a test main with a string containing the test
arguments and then in the main, check that the results are as expected.

avoid to touch sample1.ggo and sample2.ggo for make check in doc.

handle also \\t as a special char

# ~/work/gengetopt/gengetopt/build/src/gengetopt -i cmdline.ggo && make cmdline.o

package "foo"
version "1.0"

purpose "Highlight the syntax of a source file (e.g. Java) into a specific format (e.g. HTML)"
usage 
" 1. [OPTIONS]... < input_file > output_file
       2. source-highlight [OPTIONS]... -i input_file -o output_file \n
       3. source-highlight [OPTIONS]... [FILES]..."

# Options
option "input"          i  "input file. default std input"      string  typestr="filename"   no
option "output"         o  "output file. default 
std output (when the third invocation form is used). 
If STDOUT\n is specified, the output is directed to standard output"      string  typestr="filename"   no

newlines and \n are not handled correctly in the usage string
but they are in option descriptions?
