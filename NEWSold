Version 2.9

   * fixed explicit rules in Makefiles that generated errors with some
     versions of non-GNU makes.
   * names in the generated #ifndef do not contain leading paths
     (reported by Heiko Nardmann <h.nardmann@secunet.de>, Kim Bisgaard
     <kib@dmi.dk> and Guillaume Chazarain <booh@altern.org>).
   * correctly print the line number for semantic errors
     (reported by Max Bane <bane@uchicago.edu>)
   * handle group options without short options (reported by Excoffier
     Denis <Denis.Excoffier@ens.fr>)

Version 2.8.1

   * generated the parser with a new version of bison; the old one
     raised compilation errors with new gcc (reported by 
     Jens Jakobsen <jj@control.auc.dk>)
   * ignore \r characters (this used to generate problems with DOS
     text files, reported by Martin C. Martin <martin@metahuman.org>)

Version 2.8

   * Multiple options are handled (i.e., options that can be given
     more than once at command line), thanks to 
     Janico Greifenberg <jgre@tzi.de>.
   * Options can be grouped in a mutual exclusive way (thanks to
     Ronnie Lazar <Ronnie@eldat.com>).
   * Fixed default values handling for double and long types (thanks
     to Pierre Bacquet <pbacquet@delta.fr>).
   * Can generate a config option file parser (thanks to
     Jens Jakobsen <jj@control.auc.dk>)
   * Print the position of a parse error (error reported by
     Christian Richter <c.richter@sbs-or.de>)
   * backward compatibility warnings (with gcc 3.2) have been removed

Version 2.7.1

   * Fixed a problem due to namespaces in compilation (reported by Excoffier
     Denis <Denis.Excoffier@ens.fr>) with gcc 3.x.  Fixed other problems
     in compilation with gcc 3.x (reported by Ramasubramanian Vijay).
   * Anonymous CVS Access now available at
     http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gengetopt.

Version 2.7

   * Basically this is a maintenance release: C++ is now used for developing
     Gengetopt and in particular my new tool Gengen
     (http://www.lorenzobettini.it/software/gengen/) is used for
     automatically generating the code that generates the command line
     parser.

Version 2.6

   * fixed documentation (thanks to Francesco Potorti <pot@gnu.org>)
   * function names and names used in #ifndef directives in generated
     sources are canonized, thus avoiding errors by the compiler (notified
     by Francesco Potorti and Alexey Mahotkin <alexm@hsys.msk.ru>)
   * fixed line number when reporting an error in a .ggo file, and '\n' is
     no longer needed at the end of a .ggo file (notified by Francesco
     Potorti)
   * in the generated parser use HAVE_STRDUP to check whether the standard
     strdup function can be used, and use EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE for
     exit (suggested by Frans E. van Dorsselaer <frans@biabv.com>)
   * do not exit with error if an empty desc for an option is given (thanks
     to Excoffier Denis <Denis.Excoffier@ens.fr>)
   * fixed a bug in creation of string for the comment header in the
     generated sources (thanks to Xavier Trochu <xtrochu@yahoo.com>)
   * Added default values in options for integer and string options (with
     help of Ralf Zeise <Zeise@serving-gmbh.de>)

Version 2.5

   * much more recent versions of getopt.h, getopt.c, getopt1.c are provided
     (the previous ones were very very old!), that do not rely on alloca
     anymore.
   * when a flag option is given the corresponding  _given variable is set
     (bug fixed by Guillaume Chazarain  <booh@altern.org>).
   * Fixed documentation of sample1, as suggested by Lutz Maibaum
     <lutz@gold.cchem.berkeley.edu>.
   * Avoid a warning due to generated gengetopt_strdup (thanks to Brian
     Minard <bminard@flatfoot.ca>)
   * the generated print_help function use a different printf for every
     option, thus avoiding a single printf with a possible very huge string
     (thanks to Herbert Thoma <tma@iis.fhg.de>)

Version 2.4

   * fixed some bugs due to not including some headers (make check used to
     fail with gcc 2.96)
   * fixed a bug for make check, when getopt_long is not in the C library
     (reported by Paul Lew <paullew@cisco.com>).
   * the generated command line parser can be called more than once (thanks
     to Eric H Kinzie <ekinzie@cmf.nrl.navy.mil>).
   * --no-handle-error option added, so that an error in the command line
     parsing does not provoke the exit from the program: the parser simply
     returns not 0; thus the program can write something for helping the
     user.

Version 2.3

   * --no-handle-help and --no-handle-version option added, so that 
     --help|-h and --version|-V can be explicitly handled (for
      instance for printing a copyright notice, as suggested by 
      Vladimir Tamara <vtamara@gnu.org>). 
   * PURPOSE added to specify in the .ggo file the purpose of the program 
     (thanks to Berthold Höllmann <hoel@germanlloyd.org>).
   * generated print_version and print_help are not static so they can 
     be called also in the program and they are prefixed with the
     name of the generated function, so that more than one parser can be 
     handled. 
   * test the presence of alloca function in standard library 
     (reported by Aldo D. Longhi <aldo.longhi@alum.wpi.edu>). 
   * test suite added (type make check, to run the tests). 

Version 2.2

   * scanner is simplified and now accepts arbitrary character strings
     between, thanks to nbecker@fred.net.
   * It compiles under Sun C compiler 5.1, thanks to Robert Walsh
     <Robert.J.Walsh@eng.sun.com>.
   * VERSION and PACKAGE are generated in cmdline.h instead of cmdline.c,
     thanks to Richard Heggs <richard@virtua-web.co.uk>.
   * #undef's PACKAGE and VERSION before setting them, in case they are
     defined in the .ggo file, thanks to Scott Haug <scott@id3.org>.
   * long options with no associated short options are allowed, thanks to
     damned@world.std.com.
   * fixed no_getopt_long.txt, thanks to Peter Fox
     <fox@roestock.demon.co.uk>

Version 2.1

   * It is made more clear that use of gengetopt does not impose any
     particular license on the generated code.
   * A bug in the generation of code (for some new C++ compilers) was fixed,
     thanks to "James R. Van Zandt" <jrv@vanzandt.mv.com>
   * Some modifications to the man page, also due to James.
   * a directory for examples is specifically created (suggested by James).

Version 2.0

   * Gengetopt has become GNU software
   * it is conform to GNU coding standards, and so it uses configure script
     generated by Automake and Autoconf
   * it generates separated files: one header file with the struct used to
     store command line options information, and a C file which contains the
     function which actually uses getopt_long to parse the command line
   * 'required' option is now fully implemented
